## Code Example 
 DESCRIPTION:
 Write a function, which takes a non-negative integer (seconds) as input and returns the time in a human-readable format (HH:MM:SS)

 HH = hours, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 99
 MM = minutes, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
 SS = seconds, padded to 2 digits, range: 00 - 59
 The maximum time never exceeds 359999 (99:59:59)

 You can find some examples in the test fixtures.
```
function humanReadable(seconds) {
  let min = Math.floor(seconds / 60);
  let hours = Math.floor(min / 60);
  return `${hours <= 9 ? "0" + hours : hours}:${
    min % 60 <= 9 ? "0" + (min % 60) : min % 60
  }:${seconds % 60 <= 9 ? "0" + (seconds % 60) : seconds % 60}`;
}
```
